# R and RStudio Environment

`RStudio` provides an excellent interface that makes working with `R` whole lot easier. If you haven't done so, please first install the latest version of `R` before you install RStudio. 

1. Visit [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download and install `R`. You should be able to see something like: 

![](img/Rimage1.PNG) 

At this stage, you can actually start using basic functions of R, for example,  

![](img/Rimage2.PNG)

But there is a much easier alternative to run and manage R programs. `RStudio` provides an excellent IDE. Now, go ahead and

2. Visit [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), download the latest version and install. 

Now, you're ready to launch RStudio. You will see 4 windows. 

![](img/Rimage3.PNG)
<br/>

To open a new `R` script file, Click File > New File > R script. This will be your first R script. `R` script is basically a text file in which you organize your commands and codes. 

The bottom left window is the command "Console" in which you can execute your 
codes. For example, you can use R as a calculator, define and draw functions. 

# R Console

On the console just type
```{r}
2 + 2
```
```{r}
pi
```

Or

```{r}
log(exp(-5))
```
```{r}
e <- exp(1)
print(e, digits = 3)
```
```{r}
e <- exp(1)
print(e, digits = 17)
```

Well, no surprises there. Now let's try computing the number $a = (9\times 8.1) + 8.1$ which is simply 
$10\times 8.1 = 81$. Because multiplication has precedence over addition unless there is a parenthesis,  we have
```{r}
a <- 9*8.1 + 8.1
print(a)
```

But look at the digits after zero: 
```{r}
print(a, digits = 17)
```

This means the number 81 cannot be represented exactly in a computer which uses binary representation. The error in representing 81 is 
```{r}
print(81-a, digits = 17)
```

which is just $1.4210854715202004\times 10^{-14}$,  or 
```{r}
format(81-a, scientific = FALSE)
```

Is this a problem? Well, it depends on your purpose and context. Suppose that you wanted to compare the output of the arithmetic operation to a known result. We can use logical operators for that (more on this below). Consider 
```{r}
81 == a
```

This is just another way of saying that two numbers are not exactly equal. But they are nearly equal:  
```{r}
all.equal(81,a)
```

with the default tolerance level of $0.000000015$. In other words, the difference between 81 and the number `a` is less than the tolerance level. In passing, I note that the machine precision (sometimes called epsilon, $\epsilon$) in R is 
```{r}
print(.Machine$double.eps, digits=22)
```

**Exercise:** Find the largest number that can be represented in the computer smaller than 1. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
eps <- .Machine$double.eps
u <- 1-eps
print(u, digits=22) 
u<1
```


Other arithmetic operations can be problematic as well. Try subtracting 10.1 from 10.2: 
```{r}
b <- 10.2 - 10.1
print(b, digits = 17)
```

which is not exactly $0.10$. 

**Exercise** Show that the binary representation of 81 is $(1010001)$, i.e., $(81)_{10} = (1010001)_2$. Also find the binary representation of $0.10$. 


# Packages

A package is a collection of functions. An `R` function is simply a series of instructions to perform a task or computation. 

The base `R` comes with the following packages: 
```{r}
rownames(installed.packages(priority="base"))
```

`R`'s functionality can easily be extended by including software packages written by other `R` users. For example, we can install the data package for our textbook by typing the following code at the very top of the script (mind the quotation mark):

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE} 
install.packages("ISLR", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```


Alternatively, this can be done using `Tools>InstallPackages` from the menu and then typing "ISLR" on the search window. We basically downloaded this package into our computer. Now we can activate whenever we need it. To tell `R` that we will use we need a further command:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
```

This instructs `R` that our code needs to access contents of that package. Note that there is no quotation mark. 

The data set package for the second edition of ISLR can be installed using 
```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE} 
install.packages("ISLR2", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```



# File Names and Working Directory

Use `getwd()` to see the current directory. If we want to change 
it we can use setwd(path) where path should be defined using forward slash `/`, instead of backslash, `\`. 
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
getwd()
```

If we want to change it we can use `setwd("/full/address/")` where path should be defined using forward slash `/`, instead of backslash, `\`. 
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/Folder/Another-Folder/MLinEcon")
```


# Objects in `R` 

`R` is case-sensitive so `x` and `X` are different objects. The content of an object is assigned using `<-` for example: 

```{r}
x <- 5 
y <- 2 
z <- x^y 
z 
```

Note that the equation sign, `=`,  can also be used but I suggest using `<-` (don't forget to put a single space before and after). 

List of all currently available objects in the memory can be accessed using the command `ls()`

```{r}
ls()
```

Also see the `Environment` window in RStudio. 

The command `rm(x)` removes the object `x` from the memory. If you want to remove all objects, you can use `rm(list=ls())`. 

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```


## Vectors 

An `R` vector (or an atomic vector -not an algebraic vector-) is just a collection of objects. A vector my contain numeric elements (integers and doubles), logical elements, and characters. A vector can be defined in a number of ways. For example, we can use the function `c()` to create vectors `a` and `b`  

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
a
b <- c(1,1,1,1,1)
a+b
integer <- c(10L, 20L)
typeof(a)
typeof(integer)
```

```{r}
char1 <- c("small", "medium", "large")
char1
typeof(char1)
```

Let `score` be a vector with 10 elements containing evaluations on a new product out of 100 points. 

```{r}
score <- c(80, 65, 78, 94, 100, NA, 55, 85, 88, 75)
print(score)
NROW(score)
length(score)
```


Some of the widely used `R` functions for vectors are illustrated below:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# number of elements in a vector 
length(a)
# sort elements 
sort(score)
# maximum 
max(a)
# minimum
min(a)
# sum of the elements 
sum(a)
# product of the elements 
prod(a)
# vector of n zeros
numeric(5)
# create an n-vector with all elements a: rep(a, n)
rep(1,10)
# seq(T): create an integer sequence from 1 to T
seq(10)
# seq(t,T) similarly create a sequence from t to T
seq(5,10)
# seq(t,T,s) create a sequence from t to T by increment s
seq(1,10,2)
```

The elements of a vector can easily be accessed. 
```{r}
# first element 
score[1]
# first three elements
score[1:3]
# last element 
n <- length(score)
score[n]
# last three elements
score[(n-3):n]
```

**Exercise** Instead of running `score[(n-3):n]` use `score[n-3:n]`
```{r}
score[n-3:n]
```

Explain the output above. 

**Exercise** Find the index of `NA` in the vector `score` and eliminate it. Call the new vector `score2`. 

**Solution** The easiest way is to use two built-in functions `which()` and `is.na()` together. `is.na()` returns `TRUE` (more on that below) for `NA` entries, and `FALSE` otherwise.
```{r}
# is an element NA ?
is.na(score)
```

`which()` returns the index number, i.e., the position of the `NA` element in the vector. 
```{r}
# what's the position of NA 
which(is.na(score))
```

Or, find the positions of entries that are not `NA`: 
```{r}
# indices of numeric elements (excluding NAs)
which(!is.na(score))
```

where we simply used the negation `!is.na()`. Now, exclude `NA` and create a new vector: 
```{r}
score2 <- score[which(!is.na(score))]
score2
```

Actually, using `which()` is redundant in this case (unless we want to retain intermediate steps): 
```{r}
score2 <- score[!is.na(score)]
score2
```

The function `na.omit()` can also be used to drop missing observations (to be discussed later).  

A vector with **logical elements**: 
```{r}
logic1 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
print(logic1) 
```

Note that `TRUE` and `FALSE` are reserved in `R`. Here is the numerical representation of a logical vector: 
```{r} 
as.numeric(logic1) 
```

We can use logical operators, `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` ,`!=`, to create vectors with logical entries. For example, 
```{r} 
score_less_than70 <- (score < 70)
score_less_than70
```

We can easily extract the contents of `score` than satisfy `score<70` using logical subscripting. 
```{r}  
score
score[score_less_than70]
```



## Matrices 

We can create matrices in a number of ways. If we want to create a matrix based on an existing vector we can use the following command:

```{r}
A <- matrix(data=score, nrow=10, ncol=1, byrow=FALSE, dimnames=NULL)
print(A)
dim(A)
```

We can change the dimensions of the matrix, for example: 

```{r}
B <- matrix(data=score, nrow=5, ncol=2, byrow=FALSE, dimnames=NULL)
print(B)
dim(B)
```

which gives us a $5\times 2$ matrix using `byrow=FALSE` option. 

The transpose of a matrix can be found using `t()` function:   

```{r}
t(B)
```

The position of the missing element can be accessed using 
```{r}
is.na(B)
# the position of NA
which(is.na(B))
```

The position is determined column-wise. For example, consider the following 
```{r}
C <- t(B)
is.na(C)
# the position of NA
which(is.na(C))
```


Sometimes we want to create a blank matrix to be filled later in a loop. For example, 
to create a matrix of zeros use

```{r}
zeros <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
```

The functions `cbind` and `rbind` can be used to create rectangular arrays (matrices). For example 

```{r}
x <- cbind(b,a)
# also check out the following
cbind(1,1:5)
```

Let us define another column vector that contains gender:

```{r}
gender <- c("Female", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female")
print(gender) 
table(gender)
```

Think of `gender` as a categorical variable. Each observation is assigned to a gender category. 


Let us combine these two pieces of information, scores and gender, and call it `x`: 

```{r}
x<- cbind(score,gender)
x
```

Note that all elements are strings (why?). 

You can save these objects for later use: 

```{r}
save(score, gender, B, b, x, file = "../Data/myfirstRdata.RData")
```

Reload them using: 
```{r}
load("../Data/myfirstRdata.RData")
```

We combine vectors and matrices having the same dimensions into a special type of object called data frame. For example

```{r}
mydata<- data.frame(score,gender)
mydata
names(mydata)
str(mydata)
summary(mydata)
```

We will revisit data frames in the next lab session. 

## Logical vectors revisited

As we mentioned above, `TRUE` and `FALSE` are reserved words in `R` indicating whether a given statement is true or false. Internally, `TRUE` (T) is set to 1 and `FALSE` (F) is set to 0. Try the following commands yourself
```{r}
# logical operators, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
0 == 0
0 == 1
a >= 3
# note what happens if you type 
1-(a<=3)
```

We can create logical vectors using the function `logical()`, or using conditional statements on existing vectors. For example, 
```{r}
# logical creates a vector in which each element is zero
logical(5)
```
```{r}
# Which observations are Male
gender=="Male"
```
```{r}
# indicate scores higher than or equal to 75
ind <- (score>=75)
cbind(score, ind)
```


## Lists 

A __list__ is a general grouping of any kind of objects in `R` and it can have different types of the components. 
```{r, }
# Generate a list object:
mylist <- list( A=seq(8,36,4), this="that", idm = diag(3))
# Print the list: 
mylist
```

In order to name the components __names()__ command may be used.
```{r}
names(mylist)
```

Also a specific component can be refered by __list_name$component_name__.
```{r}
# Print component "A":
mylist$A
```


# Visualization: Defining and drawing curves

On the console type `help(curve)` or `?curve`: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?curve
```
```{r}
# a linear function
curve(1+2*x, from=-2, to=2, xlab="x", ylab="" )
# add a quadratic function
curve(1+2*x-2*x^2, add = TRUE, col = "red" )
# cubic
curve(1+2*x-2*x^2+3*x^3, add = TRUE, col = "blue" )

```

Another way of visualizing an algebraic function is to use `function()` and `curve()` or `plot()` together. 
```{r}
# Define the function (this is your first function here !)
fun1 <- function(x) 2*sin(x)+cos(x)
curve(fun1, -pi, pi, n = 100) 
```
```{r}
# focus on the interval -2 < x < 2
plot(fun1, -2, 2)
```
